<strong>1. INFORMATION ABOUT US</strong>
<p>F4D is a business that helps individuals connect with others and organize events where participating members collaboratively cook food. Every participant of F4D is independently responsible for the food they prepare and consume. F4D is an organizing platform with limited responsibility. Our involvement is limited to allowing individuals ("Hosts") to publicize collaborative cooking sessions and a means for collecting payment for a hosts' services of organizing and hosting collaborative cooking sessions. F4D does not guarantee that the content published is real or provide a real service. F4D is not responsible if a Host does not facilitate a session or if the food prepared in that session is not safe to consume. In this case F4D disclaims all liability.</p>

<strong>2. Signing up for a Feast</strong>
<p>When you sign up for a Collaborative Cooking Session (“Feast”) through F4D, your payment will be sent to our hosting company Hour School. If the minimum Feast size has been reached 48 hours before the Feast is to take place, the Host will receive your payment to purchase ingredients associated with the Feast. If the minimum class size is not reached participants who were registered will be refunded fully. Please ensure that you have given us a correct email address as this is how F4D will communicate with you about the Feast. Please know that 48 hours before a Feast is to take place, the Feast will be removed from our website regardless of whether the minimum class size has been reached. F4D seeks to provide a quality service, however F4D does not accept any responsibility or liability for the quality or quantity of any Feast by you or other participants of F4D.

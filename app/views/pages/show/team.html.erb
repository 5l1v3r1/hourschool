          <div class="about-bio-team-blurb">"I love traveling light, getting lost, and making new maps along the way. I like things that wear in, instead of out.  Those objects fascinate me because they're often attached to people who lead interesting lives, and those are the people I love to surround myself with. Think, make, share, rinse, and repeat.  I want to see the world through your lens and affect change locally.  I spend Sundays wrenching on old motorcycles, stop by anytime."</div>

          <div class="about-bio-team-blurb">"I surround myself with courageous people full of world-changing ideas and don't define themselves by how much they make. Turning these ideas into reality is what makes me jump out of bed every morning. I love being in the water, on the mountains and by the rocks because they remind me to not live in a bubble. I spend almost all of my money on plane tickets, visiting my friends and family that live around the world. Hong Kong, Toronto, and Austin are all homes."</div>

When not at work, I'm either running the dirt trails of Town Lake or hanging upside down from my legs on a spinning pole. I like to stay busy, active, and hungry for learning but at the end of the day I find the most joy in the simple comfort of rubbing my corgi's fuzzy belly."</div>

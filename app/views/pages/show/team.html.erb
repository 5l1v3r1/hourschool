    <div class="about-bio-team-blurb">"I love traveling light, getting lost, and making new maps along the way. I like things that wear in, instead of out.  Those objects fascinate me because they're often attached to people who lead interesting lives, and those are the people I love to surround myself with. Think, make, share, rinse, and repeat.  I want to see the world through your lens and affect change locally.  I spend Sundays wrenching on old motorcycles, stop by anytime."</div>

    <div class="about-bio-team-blurb">"I surround myself with courageous people full of world-changing ideas and don't define themselves by how much they make. Turning these ideas into reality is what makes me jump out of bed every morning. I love being in the water, on the mountains and by the rocks because they remind me to not live in a bubble. I spend almost all of my money on plane tickets, visiting my friends and family that live around the world. Hong Kong, Toronto, and Austin are all homes."</div>

      <div class="about-bio-team-blurb">"You can usually find me riding around Austin on my IRO bicycle heading to work where I develop products and services that are beautiful as well as useful. When not at work, I'm either running the dirt trails of Town Lake or hanging upside down from my legs on a spinning pole. I like to stay busy, active, and hungry for learning but at the end of the day I find the most joy in the simple comfort of rubbing my corgi's fuzzy belly."</div>

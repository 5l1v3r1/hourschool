Hello <%= @student.name.split(" ").first %>,

We hope everything went well with your <%= @course.title %> class.

If you have any feedback or suggestion for your teacher, you can leave it as a comment on the class page: <%= course_url(@course) %> . Doing so will help <%= @teacher.name %> and future students know what to expect. 

If you have feedback specifically for HourSchool, please let us know here:
<%= feedback_url(:id => @course) %>

<% if community_site? %>
  Cheers!
